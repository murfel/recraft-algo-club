# Dynamic Programming 1

## Grasshopper Problem

### Setup

Grasshoper jumps on checkered strip. Grasshopper starts on cell 0 and can jump one or two cells forward only.

For N = 10, the strip looks like this. The dot (`.`) denotes the grashopper's initial position in the cell 0.
```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[.| | | | | | | | | ]
```

To illustrate how the grasshopper moves, grasshopper's first move brings her to either cell 1 or 2.

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[ |.| | | | | | | | ]

 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[ | |.| | | | | | | ]
```

### Number of paths
How many paths there exist to the N-th cell?

**Exercise.** Write down how many paths there are for each cell starting from cell 0, then 1, then 2, etc.

- For convenience, we set the number of paths for cell 0 to be equal to 1.
- #paths to cell 1 is equal to 1, as we can only jump +1 from cell 1.
- #paths to cell 2 is eqaul to 2, as we can either jump +2 from cell 0 or jump +1 from cell 1.

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[1|1|2| | | | | | | ]
```

Notice the pattern. What is this sequence called?

### Code

The algorithms: we know the answer for each cell before `i`-th, and want to calculate the answer for the `i`-th cell.
We could only arrive to the `i`-th cell either from `i-1`-st or `i-2`-nd. Conveniently, we already know the number of paths for cells `i-1` and `i-2`.

```
dp = N * [0]
dp[0] = 1
dp[1] = 1  # for convinience, to avoid iffing in the for-loop
for i=2..N-1:
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
            # if the last jump was +1
                        # if the last jump was +2
```

### Minimum cost
Now each cell has a cost that grasshopper has to pay if she jumps on that cell. Find the value of the minimum-cost path, and then find the path itself.

```
N = 6
 0 1 2 3 4 5
[5|3|1|3|2|4] - costs
[.| | | | | ]
```

At each step `i`, we could only come from `i - 1` or `i - 2`. So choose the smaller one. 
```
costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = N * [0]
dp[0] = costs[0]
dp[1] = costs[0] + costs[1]
for i=2..N-1:
    dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + costs[i]
```

Alternative code:
```
dp = N * [-INF]  # in Python it's `float(-INF)`
for ...
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 2] + costs[i])
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[i])

```


### Relax

Define the relax function, to simplify the code. 
```
def relax(i, value):
    global dp
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], value)
```

Now the code could be rewritten as:

```
costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = N * [-INF]
dp[0] = costs[0]
dp[1] = costs[0] + costs[1]
for i=2..N-1:
    dp[i] = relax(i, dp[i - 2] + costs[i])
    dp[i] = relax(i, dp[i - 1] + costs[i])
```

### Answer retrieval
The answer path is an increasing subsequence of indexes on the strip that allows us to pay the minimum price.

```
N = 6
 0 1 2 3 4 5
[5|3|1|3|2|4] - costs
[5|8|6|9|8|12] - dp (minimum costs to get from cell 0 to each i-th cell)
+2 +2 +1 - sequence of jumps
0 2 4 5 - answer path
```

There are two approaches to retrieve the answer path: by **calculating** and by storing **parents**.

#### Calculating
First, you calculate the `dp` array. Then you can start from the last value `dp[N-1]` and at each step `i` re-calculate how you got there (by jump+1 or jump+2?), either by taking minimum of `dp[i-1], dp[i-2]` or by comparing which of the two previous values, `dp[i-1], dp[i-2]`, are equal to `dp[i] - costs[i]`.

Pros: no extra memory required, cons: you have to repeat the calculations, which could be computationally heavy, or could give you an extra place to make a bug (the less code, the better!).

#### Storing parents
An easier approach is to store a parent cell for each cell.

```
costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = N * [-INF]

parents = N * [-1] # NEW

def relax(i, value):
    global dp
    if dp[i] > value:        # NEW
         dp[i] = value       # NEW
         parents[i] = value  # NEW

dp[0] = costs[0]
dp[1] = costs[0] + costs[1]
for i=2..N-1:
    dp[i] = relax(i, dp[i - 2] + costs[i])
    dp[i] = relax(i, dp[i - 1] + costs[i])
```

`parents` array IS NOT the answer path. It is simply a list of the best predesessor for each index. As such, it contains all the data to find the answer path.

```
path = []
i = N - 1
while i != -1:
    path.append(i)
    i = parents[i]
path.reverse()  # because we accumulated indexes from the end to the start
print(path)
```

```
N = 6
  0 1 2 3 4 5
 [5|3|1|3|2|4] - costs
 [5|8|6|9|8|12] - dp (minimum costs to get from cell 0 to each i-th cell)
[-1|0|0|2|2|4] - parents
+2 +2 +1 - sequence of jumps
0 2 4 5 - answer path
```

## Vocabulary

Six features of a dynamic programming problem.

1. State
  - The state `dp[i]` is the minimal price to get from cell `0` to cell `i`, using only jump+1 or jump+2 jumps.
  - the index in the dp array + interpretation (one sentence in English describing what value it holds)
2. Base case
  - `dp[0] = costs[0]`
  - `dp[1] = costs[0] + costs[1]`
  - Try to use as minimal base case as possible.
     - I.e. we could also define `dp[2] = costs[0] + costs[2]` if costs are always non-negative, but it's redundant, as `i=2` could be calculated with the rest of the indexes in the for-loop.
  - Feel free to use a bigger one for convinience, though.
     - I.e. defining `dp[0]` only is enough, as `dp[1]` could be calculated inside the for-loop with the rest of the indexes, if we add some iffing:

```
dp[0] = costs[0]
for i=1..N-1:
    if i - 2 > 0:  # UGLY
        update dp[i] using i - 2
    update dp[i] using i - 1
```

However, that produces quite an ugly code with an if statement that is only triggered once. Using two base cases makes this code much cleaner and readable.

3. Transitions
  - Each `dp[i]` depends on two previous states, `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. So there are two transitions. We can either update (relax) the value of `dp[i]` with `dp[i - 1]` or `dp[i - 2]`.
4. Order of calculation
  - We calculate `dp` values from 0 to N-1.
5. Answer
  - The answer is in `dp[N - 1]`.
6. Answer retrieval
  - Store parents.
