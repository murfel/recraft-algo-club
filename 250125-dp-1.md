# Dynamic Programming 1

## Grasshopper Problem

### Setup

Grasshoper jumps on checkered strip. Grasshopper starts on cell 0 and can jump one or two cells forward only.

For N = 10, the strip looks like this. The dot (`.`) denotes the grashopper's initial position in the cell 0.
```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[.| | | | | | | | | ]
```

To illustrate how the grasshopper moves, grasshopper's first move brings her to either cell 1 or 2.

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[ |.| | | | | | | | ]

 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[ | |.| | | | | | | ]
```

### Number of paths
How many paths there exist to the N-th cell?

**Exercise.** Write down how many paths there are for each cell starting from cell 0, then 1, then 2, etc.

- For convenience, we set the number of paths for cell 0 to be equal to 1.
- #paths to cell 1 is equal to 1, as we can only jump +1 from cell 1.
- #paths to cell 2 is eqaul to 2, as we can either jump +2 from cell 0 or jump +1 from cell 1.

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[1|1|2| | | | | | | ]
```

Notice the pattern. What is this sequence called?

### Code

The algorithms: we know the answer for each cell before `i`-th, and want to calculate the answer for the `i`-th cell.
We could only arrive to the `i`-th cell either from `i-1`-st or `i-2`-nd. Conveniently, we already know the number of paths for cells `i-1` and `i-2`.

```
dp = N * [0]
dp[0] = 1
dp[1] = 1  # for convinience, to avoid iffing in the for-loop
for i=2..N-1:
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
            # if the last jump was +1
                        # if the last jump was +2
```

### Minimum cost
Now each cell has a cost that grasshopper has to pay if she jumps on that cell. Find the value of the minimum-cost path, and then find the path itself.

```
N = 6
 0 1 2 3 4 5
[5|3|1|3|8|4] - costs
[.| | | | | ]
```

```
costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = N * [0]
dp[0] = costs[0]
dp[1] = costs[1]
for i=2..N-1:
    dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + costs[i],
                dp[i - 2] + costs[i])
```
